Now we define the Material section. {placeholder}
This is the syntax of the Material section:

Material(no: int = 1, name: str = 'S235', comment: str = '', params: dict = None, model = Model)

avoid to fill params when not requested by the user.


This is an example of the Material section:

# ---- Material Sec ----
Material(1, "S235")
